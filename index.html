        <h5>¿ Where is it located?</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>I am going to introduce a town called Pamplona which is my birthplace
            </li>
            <li>I am currently in the city of Cúcuta Norte de Santander is on the border with Valenzuela.
            </li>
            <li>Pamplona is recognized as the mitred city since it is a very religious town and gathers many celebrations of the Catholic church.
            </li>
            <li>The word mitrada comes from the term mitra used by priests.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>¿ How is? </h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Pamplona is a town close to the Venezuelan border, two hours away and one hour from the city of Cúcuta</li>
            <li>It is very green thanks to its vegetation and its mountainous relief.
            </li> 
            <li>It is too cold more than in Bogota.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Personal opinion : Why have you chosen that place?</h5>
        <p>I have chosen Pamplona since it is my birthplace for that reason and because of its climate it is my favorite place and I wanted to share it through this work
